This week I had to establish async communication between microservices. I didn't know how to user rabbitmq inside kubenetes cluster. This is the project that I did to learn  how to use rabbitmq inside kubenetes cluster. The Consumer_app contains a node app which listens to message published to rabbitmq. And the Node_app folder contains a express server which has the route "/:msg" implement to publish messages into the queue which is been listened by consumer app. K8s continas the deployment config files of consumer and publisher apps. Rabbitmq_configs folder contains all the different configs for rabbitmq, which I got from different sources (AIs). Chat GPT configs is the one which I tested, and surprisingly it worked. So I didn't test the others.
